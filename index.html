  <p>The Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan, presented four months ago to Parliament, has focused on four priority areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>A massive rollout of infrastructure throughout South Africa</li>
<li>A massive increase in local production</li>
<li>An employment stimulus to create jobs and support livelihoods</li>
<li>The rapid expansion of our energy generation capacity</li>

  <h2>Infrastructure</h2>

<ul>
<li>Technical skills have had to be built within the government to prepare and manage large infrastructure projects</li>
<li>An infrastructure investment project pipeline worth R340-billion in 
network industries such as energy, water, transport and 
telecommunications has been developed. Construction has started and 
progress has been made</li>
<li>Two major human settlements projects that will provide homes to 
almost 68 000 households in Gauteng province have begun. Similar 
projects are planned in other provinces</li>
<li>New post-apartheid cities, announced two years ago, are being 
conceptualised in a number of places. The master plan for the first, the
 Lanseria Smart City, which will house between 350 000 and 500 000 
people, is now out for public comment</li>
<li>Progress is being made on several major water infrastructure 
projects: Phase 2A of the Mokolo and Crocodile River project, and the 
uMkhomazi Water Project</li>
<li>The Infrastructure Investment Plan identifies road projects worth 
R19-billion. Work is under way to finalise project finance structuring</li>
<li>Resources have been committed from the fiscus to support the construction and rehabilitation of the N1, N2, and N3 highways</li>
<li>The R100-billion Infrastructure Fund is now in full operation. Its 
approved project pipeline for 2021 is varied: it includes the Student 
Housing Infrastructure Programme, which aims to provide 300 000 student 
beds, and SA Connect, a programme to roll out broadband to schools, 
hospitals, police stations and other government facilities</li>
</ul>

<h2>Industrialisation and local production</h2>

<ul>
<li>Supporting a massive increase in local production and making South 
African exports globally competitive will encourage greater investment 
by the private sector in productive activity</li>
<li>Key to this plan is a renewed commitment from government, business and organised labour to buy local</li>
<li>All social partners who participated in the development of the 
Economic Reconstruction and Recovery Plan have agreed to work together 
to reduce our reliance on imports by 20% over the next five years</li>
<li>They have identified 42 products â€“ ranging from edible oils to 
furniture, fruit concentrates, personal protective equipment, steel 
products and green economy inputs â€“ that can be sourced locally</li>
<li>Achieving this target will significantly expand our productive 
economy, potentially returning more than R200-billion to the countryâ€™s 
annual output</li>
<li>Last year, we undertook to create a larger market for small 
businesses and designate 1 000 locally produced products that must be 
procured from SMMEs. The closure of global supply chains owing to 
COVID-19 has allowed this process to be accelerated</li>
<li>The departments of Small Business Development and Trade, Industry 
and Competition are supporting SMMEs to access larger domestic and 
international markets</li>
<li>Four master plans to rejuvenate and grow key industries have been 
completed and signed to date, and have already had an impact in their 
respective industries</li>
<li>Through the poultry master plan, the industry has invested 
R800-million to upgrade production. South Africa now produces an 
additional one million chickens weekly</li>
<li>The sugar master plan includes a commitment from large users of 
sugar to procure at least 80% of their sugar needs from local growers</li>
<li>The clothing, textile, footwear and leather master plan has seen the
 investment of more than R500-million to expand local manufacturing 
facilities</li>
<li>The auto sector has recovered around 70% of its normal annual 
production, in difficult circumstances. Last week, the Ford Motor 
Company announced a R16-billion investment to expand their manufacturing
 facility in Tshwane; Toyota has invested in its KwaZulu-Natal facility;
  investment announcements have been made by Nissan, Mercedes-Benz and 
Isuzu</li>

<li>This year, our focus will be on getting the industry back to full 
production, implementing the Black Industrialist Fund and working on a 
new platform for expanded auto trade with the rest of the continent</li>
<li>Also this year, we will begin to harness the opportunities presented
 by the African Continental Free Trade Area, which came into operation 
on 1 January. It provides a platform for South African businesses to 
expand into markets across the continent</li>
<li>Last year, government agreed to landmark deals with companies that 
will advance black economic empowerment by transferring ownership to 
their workers</li>
<li>In November last year, we held our third South Africa Investment 
Conference to review the implementation of previous commitments and to 
generate new investment into our economy. The Investment Conference 
managed to raise R108-billion in additional investment commitments, 
bringing the total for the last three years to R773-billion. Around 
R183-billion has already flowed into projects</li>
<li>In the past year, more than 125 000 new companies have been 
registered through the BizPortal platform, completing their registration
 in a matter of hours</li>

  <ul>
<li>We continue to work in a social compact with the private sector to 
create a more conducive environment for it to be able to create jobs</li>
<li>The Presidential Employment Stimulus is one of the most significant 
expansions of public and social employment in South Africaâ€™s history: by
 the end of January, over 430 000 opportunities had been supported. A 
further 180 000 opportunities are currently in the recruitment process</li>
<li>The National Youth Development Agency and the Department of Small 
Business Development provided grant funding and business support to 1 
000 young entrepreneurs</li>
<li>More than 1.2-million young people are already in the national 
Pathway Management Network, which provides support and opportunities to 
young people.</li>
<li>It is a priority for 2021 to regain lost time and improve 
educational outcomes, from the early years to post-school education and 
training</li>
</ul>

<h2>Energy security</h2>

<ul>
<li>Restoring Eskom to operational and financial health and accelerating its restructuring process is central to this objective</li>
<li>Eskom has been restructured into three separate entities for 
generation, transmission and distribution, laying the foundations for an
 efficient, modern and competitive energy system</li>
<li>Eskom is making substantial progress with its intensive maintenance 
and operational excellence programmes to improve the reliability of its 
coal fleet</li>
<li>The government is working closely with Eskom on proposals to improve
 its financial position, manage its debt and reduce its dependence on 
the fiscus</li>
<li>The electricity tariff path is to be reviewed, to ensure that it 
reflects all reasonable costs and measures to resolve the problem of 
municipal debt</li>
<li>In December 2020, the government and its social partners signed the 
historic Eskom Social Compact, which outlines the necessary actions we 
must take to meet the countryâ€™s current and future energy needs</li>
<li>Action has been taken to urgently and substantially increase generation capacity in addition to what Eskom generates:

<ul>
<li>successful bids for 2 000 megawatts of emergency power generation will soon be announced;</li>
<li>regulations have been amended and the requirements clarified for municipalities to buy power from independent power producers;</li>
<li>the government will soon be initiating the procurement of an 
additional 11 800 megawatts of power from renewable energy, natural gas,
 battery storage and coal</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The government will in the coming weeks open bid window 4 of the 
renewal energy programme for 2 600 megawatts from wind and solar energy</li>
<li>The government will amend Schedule 2 of the Electricity Regulation 
Act within the next three months to increase the licensing threshold for
 embedded generation projects, unlocking up to 5 000 megawatts more - 
capacity.</li>
<li>We are working to fulfil our commitments under the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement which 
include the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Eskom has committed 
in principle to net zero emissions by 2050</li>
<li>Our work on climate change will be guided by the Presidential 
Coordinating Commission on Climate Change, which is meeting for the 
first time this month. It will work on a plan for a just transition to a
 low-carbon economy and climate resilient society</li>
</ul>
